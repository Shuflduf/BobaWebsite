      <h3>Trends</h3>
      <p>
        <i>
          There are some thing I noticed from the projects I have this year,
          here are some of the most interesting observations.
        </i>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>I like arcade games</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Even though we live in a time where computers can process billions
            of triangles in the blink of an eye, I often make games based on
            games that were made everyone had a computer in their pocket. The
            best example of this is the tetr.lang series, where I remade Tetris
            in various languages, ranging from Rust, to Go, and Godot. There are
            other projects, such as Physics Pacman, that also show this point.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Hack Club is a big contributer in why I program</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Observe the following graph: <br />
            <img src="assets/projects_chart.png" width="50%" /> <br />
            As you can see, there are two spikes during the months of August and
            December, with the December spike being smaller, and all other
            months being relatively empty. I also had zero projects at the
            beginning of the year. The spike in August can be explained with
            <a href="https://hackclub.com/arcade/">Hack Club Arcade</a>, a
            system where you could make projects to earn real rewards. I needed
            a laptop for the upcoming high school years, so I had to make a lot
            of project to earn it. The December spike can be explained with
            <a href="https://highseas.hackclub.com/">Hack Club High Seas</a>, a
            different event, with a similar premise. As I'm writing this, the
            event is currently ongoing, so in reality the December spike would
            be as big as the August spike when the year ends.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>I learned more over time</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This one sounds obvious, but at the beggining of the year I used a
            LOT of Godot, for almost everything. An exmapel of this is Grup, a
            CLI that searchs files for a pattern, but made entirely in Godot. As
            time went on, I learnt more languages, such as Rust, Kotlin, and Go,
            and I became more low-level. Most of the later projects have their
            own drawing APIs for different components, and everything is handled
            by me.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ol>

      <h2>The Future</h2>
      <p>
        I love progamming, and I'll probably do a lot of it in 2025, probably an
        unhealthy amount. I also want to participate in more Hack Club events,
        like game jams and Hackathons. In face, I'm planning to host
        <a href="https://scrapyard.hackclub.com/">Hack Club Scrapyard</a> in
        Calgary on March 15-16, along with some of my friends.
